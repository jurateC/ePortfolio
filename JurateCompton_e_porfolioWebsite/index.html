            <p><img id="pic" src="images/IMG_5613%20(1).JPG" alt="Portrait of a woman">My name is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Jurate Compton</span> .<br> I am from Lithuania originally, but for the last 17 years I have lived in Ireland. I came to Ireland for 3 months, but I liked it so much that I stayed here, and  <a class="trimlink" href="trim.html" target="_blank">Trim</a> town has become my home.<br>
                I am a 45 year old student, and I am very proud of myself! After finishing Secondary School, I never got the chance to go to college. Not many of my friends or family back home were going to college, so I followed suit and got a job and started family, but I always wanted something more.<br>
                Now I am in my second semester in TU Dublin studying Creative Digital Media and could not be happier. Even though in the beginning it was a little bit hard to adapt, I enjoy every minute of my studying. I learned so much this year and have partly fulfilled my dream. <br>
                I have always been creative - all my childrenâ€™s birthday party decorations, Halloween costumes, Christmas decorations and presents were made by me. I love painting, crafting, sewing and I am always full of ideas. Another of my hobbies is photography. When I was a child, my brother had a camera and a dark room to develop film photographs, and I was fascinated with the process.<br>
                When I applied for the Creative Digital Media degree, I was a little bit worried about the Web Development course. I was not sure if I like it. I was so wrong! Now this course is one of my favourites.<br>
